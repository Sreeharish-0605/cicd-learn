To understand Kubernetes via Minikube we will be using the following resources

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/
* https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
* https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/kubernetes-declaratively-deploying-infrastructure-iac-789f14d999c6

For reference, the files app1.yml, app2.yml and nginx-app-service.yml are also attached

The commands we would run are

1. kubectl apply -f app1.yml
2. kubectl apply -f app2.yml
3. kubectl apply -f nginx-app-service.yml

This will create the deployment

We can then check the deployment by 

kubectl get all

and

minikube service nginx-app-service

We can reduce the number of instances in the deployment by running

kubectl scale deployment deployment1 --replicas=1

finally we can delete the deployment entirely by doing

kubectl delete all --all
